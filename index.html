Hey there! Interested in my site, eh? It's fairly simple, the only _slightly_ complicated part is the party mode. Have fun looking at the code!

P.S. curious to why I didn't use bootstrap or something like that? I just wanted to keep everything pretty simple, and didn't really feel like importing any non-standard js/css.

	<p>Hi there, welcome to my personal website!</p>

	<p>So, you've probably come here to see projects, right? Well, currently I don't have much of my stuff uploaded to GitHub yet, so I guess I'll just bore you with my interests instead.</p>

	<h2>Interests and skills</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Amateur radio</li>
			<p>I'm a mostly inactive ham, but I do occasionally enjoy doing radio stuff when I have time. I hold the basic with honors and advanced certificates.</p>
		<li>Programming</li>
