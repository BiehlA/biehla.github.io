	<p>Hi there, welcome to my personal website!</p>
	
	<p></p>

	<p>So, you've probably come here to see projects, right? Well, currently I don't have much of my stuff uploaded to GitHub yet, so I guess I'll just bore you with my interests instead.</p>

	<h2>Interests and skills</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Amateur radio</li>
			<p>I'm a mostly inactive ham, but I do occasionally enjoy doing radio stuff when I have time. I hold the basic with honors and advanced certificates.</p>
		<li>Programming</li>
			<p>I like fiddling around with code and stuff. I'm pretty proficient with Python and Arduino. My latest project was a Morse Code keyer for paddle keyers.</p>
		<li>3D Modeling</li>
			<p>I do digital art and stuff, yo.</p>
		<li>Building stuff</li>
			<p>Yeah, there's a non computer thing here. Amazing!</p>
		<li>Again, really anything to do with computers and electronics.</li>
	</ul>
